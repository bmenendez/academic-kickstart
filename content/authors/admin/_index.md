Hi! I'm a PhD in Operations Research fascinated about Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing, with a focus on the design and development of algorithms. Metaheuristics passionate, I've also developed optimization engines applying Linear and Constraint Programming techniques.

Currently working with QUBO/Ising models to efficiently solve hard combinatorial optimization problems within a Quantum-inspired computer: Digital Annealer. Eager to keep learning and applying knowledge to solve challenging problems.
